# Project 

A smartwatch layout to show time, calendar and weather using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This project is fully responsive and very easy to understand.
When user clicks on calendar icon the calendar pops up and shows actual date along with other details similarly weather icon shows city weather.

I have used openweathermap for API to show weather details and for other things, I have used javascript and CSS for styling.
